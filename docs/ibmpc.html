<p>The IBM Personal Computer, introduced in 1981, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of personal computing.</p>
<p>It was built with an Intel 8088 processor and initially came with 16 KB of memory, expandable to 256 KB.</p>
<p>The IBM PC popularized the architecture and operating system standards (notably MS-DOS) that would dominate the personal computing market for decades.</p>
<p>It offered several model configurations, including options without a hard drive, using floppy disks for storage instead.</p>
<p>The IBM PC's open architecture fostered a vast ecosystem of software and hardware expansion, setting the stage for the modern PC industry.</p>
