  <p>The Banu Musa automatic flute is a mechanical hydraulic organ operating automatically by the action of weight and water pressure. The air pushed by the hydraulic pump is compressed in a sphere to power a flute with nine holes. The holes are opened and closed by levers, the ends of which make contact with the fixed raised pins arranged on the surface of a revolving cylinder.</p>\

  <p>On the left of the diagram is a system of gears, which when activated by hydraulic wheel allows the alternate flow of water into the two compartments of the pump.</p>
  <p>The spherical air compressor is located above the main body of the air pump; it acts as bellows and receives air continuously from the two pump compartmpents and sends it to the flute through a pipe fixed to one end of the flute.</p>
  <p>The revolving cylinder with pins is on the right side of the diagram. A gear system, activated by a hydraulic wheel, turns the cylinder in a uniform circular motion. The speed of rotation is regulated by the stream of water from the valve. A regulating system is in place to either increase or decrease the speed of rotation.</p>
  <p>By changing the revolving cylinder with pins, the machine could be made to play different musical pieces. As such, it is probably the first known programmable machine.</p>
