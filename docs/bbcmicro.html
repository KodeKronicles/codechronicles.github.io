<p>The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, was developed by Acorn Computers in 1981 as part of the BBC's Computer Literacy Project aimed at educating the British public in computing.</p>
<p>The system was notable for its robust build, high-quality graphics, and powerful programming capabilities in BBC BASIC language.</p>
<p>It played a crucial role in the education of a generation, providing students and teachers with a reliable platform for learning computing concepts and programming, and it supported a range of peripherals that further enhanced its utility in educational settings.</p>
