  <p>The Al Jazari drum machine was an early programmable automata with a drum machine with pegs that bumb into levers operating the percussion.</p>
  <p>Al Jazari has created two different machines that used this concept.</p>
  <p>The first was a musical robot band, which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties.</p>

  <p>The second was the water-clock of the drummers, which produced a musical piece after an interval of 30 to 60 minutes.</p>

  <p>Both machines have utilised hydraulic switching, pistons and cables, operating on the alternating flow of water between two large tanks.</p>
