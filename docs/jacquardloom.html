  <p>Jacquard loom is a loom, in which the weaving pattern is programmable by a set of punched cards laced together in a sequence.</p>
  <p>This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, having inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p>

  <p>The cards are fastened into a continuous chain which passes over a square box. At each quarter rotation a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row (one "pick" of the shuttle carrying the weft).</p>
  <p>The box swings from the side and presses against the control rods. Where there is a hole the rod passes through the card and is unmoved, whereas if the hole is not punched the rod is pushed to the left. Each rod acts upon a hook. When the rod is pushed in, the hook moves out of position to the left, a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place.</p>
  <p>A beam then rises under the hooks and those hooks in the rest location are raised; the hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam. Each hook can have multiple cords. The cords pass through a guide and are attached to their heddle and a return weight. The heddles raise the warp to create the shed through which the shuttle carrying the weft will pass.</p>
  <p>A loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 warp ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.</p>
