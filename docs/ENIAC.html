  <p>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), unveiled in 1946 at the University of Pennsylvania, stands as a monument to human ingenuity and technological prowess.</p>
  <p>Conceived in the crucible of World War II, ENIAC represented a quantum leap forward in computing capability. Comprising over 17,000 electronic valves and weighing nearly 30 tons, ENIAC was a behemoth of its time.</p>
  <p>Its pioneering use of electronic components, rather than mechanical switches, facilitated blazing-fast calculations, making it indispensable for tasks ranging from ballistics computations to nuclear weapons design. ENIAC's legacy endures as a cornerstone of modern computing, laying the groundwork for subsequent generations of electronic computers.</p>
